# NSC-A1: Mono-Alphabetic Substitution Cipher

## Overview
This assignment implements encryption and decryption using a **Mono-Alphabetic Substitution Cipher**. The cipher replaces each letter in the plaintext with a corresponding letter from a fixed substitution mapping (key). It is one of the simplest and most basic forms of encryption, often used as an introduction to cryptography.

---

## Features
- **Encryption**: Converts plaintext into ciphertext using a substitution mapping.
- **Decryption**: Converts ciphertext back into plaintext using the inverse of the substitution mapping.
- **Key**: A fixed substitution mapping for the alphabet, ensuring a one-to-one correspondence between plaintext and ciphertext characters.
